                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwalior was once not only the
                capital of Scindias but is also a historically rich and one of the most
                popular cities of Madhya Pradesh. Gwalior has always been loved and visited by tourists for their
                stunning forts and intricate palaces that were at some point ruled by rulers of different era like the
                Mughals and in fact even the Tomars. The city was first ruled by them before it was seized by the
                Scindias. Gwalior are been popularly called as the Fort City and the city stands true to its name. When
                you visit Gwalior, you will also agree. Located at 122 km from Agra, Gwalior is also flanked by one of
                the biggest commercial and industrial zones and because it is also one of the largest city of Central
                India, Gwalior is today one of the biggest tourist attractions of Madhya Pradesh. And apart from all
                this, Gwalior was also one among the five princely states that got the honor of 21 gun salute during the
                British rule
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth largest city of
                Madhya Pradesh, Gwalior has also known to be an educational hub owing to the
                Scindia School that is situated right inside the Gwalior fort. This school was built in 1897 and today
                is considered to be one among the many important boarding schools of India. Initially this school was
                built only to be used by the nobles and also the princes. Also known as the city of music, it is said
                that this city was once visited by Tansen and today it houses one of the oldest and popular gharanas
                also called school of Hindustani classical music. This place is also Tansen’s final resting place apart
                from one of the nine gems that belong to Emperor Akbar’s court. The first ever museum that displays and
                exhibits musical instruments was built in Gwalior known as the Sarod Ghar.

                    fortresses in India’, the impenetrable Gwalior Fort has
                    witnessed many wars and events. Standing tall atop a rocky mountain, this architectural marvel
                    spreads over an area of 3 sq. km and is visible from all the corners of the city. There are several
                    attractions inside the fort including palaces, temples and water tanks, and it might take almost a
                    day to explore the place.</p>

                    Jayaji Rao Scindia in 1874. The building has European
                    style architecture and is quite famous for its Durbar Hall, which is adorned with some of the
                    grandest chandeliers in the world and a huge carpet that took nearly 12 years to weave. The rooms in
                    the palace have been converted into a museum, and exhibit furniture, paintings, sculptures,

                    Mitaoli (or Mitavali) is among only a handful of such
                    circular temples in India dedicated (originally, in this case) to a cult goddess. The structure has
                    been heavily restored, the original sculptures are all gone, the temple is now dedicated to Shiv and
                    is called the Ekateshwar Mahadev temple. However the circular nature of the structure and its
                    location on a hill are beautiful, and many believe that its concentric layout with one circular
                    building nestled inside another was the inspiration for India’s present parliament building.</p>

                    the name suggests, this temple is actually named after sahastrabahu, another name of Lord Vishnu.
                    King Mahipala of Kacchapaghata Dynasty constructed this temple in the 11th century.</p>
